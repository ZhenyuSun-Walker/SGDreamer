This living room is a cozy mix of contemporary and vintage, featuring a plush velvet sofa in deep blue, a reclaimed wood coffee table adorned with fresh flowers. To the left, a sleek media console holds a flat-screen TV, while on the right, a gallery wall showcases family photos in mismatched frames.
